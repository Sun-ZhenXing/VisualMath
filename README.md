Sympy-based mathematical computing services
==================
| 中文：![中文README][README_zh]

It is highly recommended to take a look at the introduction: https://sun-zhenxing.gitee.io/myblog/pages/visualmath.html

Framework for Open Source Mathematical Computing Services.

Simple and easy to use, it is a nice little tool to get rid of the DOS sympy can only see characters, not see the trouble of mathematical equations.

## This project is based on a number of frameworks
```
KATEX's Fastest Web Typesetting Library
layui is a simple and easy to use web framework
flask server framework
jQuery All web logic is written by jq
```
## support
The methods currently supported within SymPy are basically callable, with the possibility of adding drawing, pseudo-code, machine proof, etc.

## dependence
Version required: python3.x | Other latest available

```
pip install sympy
pip install flask
pip install latex2mathml
```
## Download to computer
Direct download in a package, no additional operations required

Or git clone to the computer.

## Usage
You can run flask_server.py directly

You can modify parameters, customize methods in utils.py
